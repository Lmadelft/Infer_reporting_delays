# Infer_reporting_delays
This code is to infer the reporting delays of infections, recoveries, and deaths based on the time series of daily infections, recoveries, and deaths. The data considered in this file are the infections, recoveries, and deaths in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic for Spain. The code is to smooth the time series first. In each step, we randomly choose candidate delay parameters. Then we do 10^7 random search to find the delay distributions which can make the revised time series turn proportional to each other. We consider the Pólya–Aeppli distributions. The output matrix saverandomnb saved the candidate delay parameters saverandomnb(numi,1:6) and the value of the loss function saverandomnb(numi,7). The optimization results of distribution parameters in each realization are usually different, but should be close to p_D = 0.6574 p_I = 0.1632 p_R = 0.0553 r_D = 0.1713 r_I = 1.0803 r_R = 1.2673.
